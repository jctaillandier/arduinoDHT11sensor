# Simple DHT11 and Liquid Crystal screen combination / Arduino Uno


- use DHT11 basic temperature and humidity sensor
- prints on serial monitor data
- Use potentiometer in pair with liquidCrystal screen

* careful with 'LiquidCrystal lcd(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7);' and make sure you understand where to plug pins

Wanted to use serial-port package from npm, having issues, which I raised in their github page, still no answer.
My code has been confirmed to work on other machines... Input appreciated
